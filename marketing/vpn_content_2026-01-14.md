**Title:** TIFU by NOT using a VPN on a "secure" network. My gamer friend just lost his 8-year-old Steam account.

**Body:** Hey everyone, throwaway for obvious reasons. I need to share this as a warning, especially to my fellow gamers and privacy-conscious folks.

Last week, my buddy and I were at a convention center for a local gaming event. They had "secured" guest WiFi. We both connected. I always fire up my NordVPN the second I join any public network—force of habit. He shrugged and said, "It's fine, it's the event's WiFi."

Fast forward 48 hours. He gets an email that his password was changed. Then, his Steam Guard was bypassed. Then, poof. Eight years of games, saves, and items... gone. The "secured" network was apparently a playground for packet sniffing.

The IT guy we spoke to later basically said these networks are often targeted because they're full of "high-value" targets with gaming and social media accounts. My friend's digital life got stripped because he didn't have a basic layer of encryption.

The crazy part? I was on the SAME network, browsing the same stuff, even logged into my own accounts. Zero issues. The only difference was the VPN tunnel. I use NordVPN specifically for its double VPN and threat protection features—it just silently blocks malicious sites and hides my traffic.

He's now going through Steam support hell. I'm just sitting here, my privacy intact, streaming Netflix libraries from three different countries like nothing happened. The "Us vs Them" is real—it's the protected vs. the exposed.

Don't be my friend. Get a shield. It's not just about Netflix; it's about everything you own online.

**Title:** TIFU by not using a VPN and my entire gaming account got wiped. A cautionary tale.

**Body:**  
So this happened last week. I was on open WiFi at a cafe, grinding ranks in my favorite FPS. Thought nothing of it. Next day, login failed. Someone had breached my account, sold all my skins, and deleted my characters. Years of progress—gone.

I contacted support, but without 2FA (my mistake), there was little they could do. The hacker had gotten in through an unsecured connection, probably sniffed my data like it was nothing.

A friend, who’s a cyber sec guy, asked me one question: “Why weren’t you using a VPN? Especially ExpressVPN? It encrypts everything, even on public WiFi.”

I felt so stupid. I always thought VPNs were just for Netflix or whatever. But he showed me how it hides your IP, secures your traffic, and even reduces throttling so your games run smoother.

I’ve switched now. Using ExpressVPN. The speed is insane—no lag, plus I can access game servers early in other regions. And yes, I’m finally watching Netflix Japan.

Don’t be like me. Your data is being watched, sold, and exploited every day. If you game or care about privacy at all, this isn’t an option. It’s a necessity.

Stay safe out there.

1. Your ISP is selling your search history. Gamers, they're literally watching your every move. 😳

Surfshark VPN encrypts everything. Keep your raids private. 🛡️

#VPN #CyberSecurity #Privacy

2. Broke: Paying for 10 streaming services. Woke: Using Surfshark to unblock EVERY Netflix library globally. 🎬

Imagine having 10x the content for the price of a VPN. Your friends are already doing it. #FOMO

#VPN #Privacy

3. "Why is my ping so high?" - You, without a gaming-optimized VPN. 🎮

Surfark's WireGuard protocol = near-zero speed loss. Dominate lobbies with zero throttling. They can't beat you if they can't track you.

**Title:** TIFU by not using a VPN and my entire gaming clan got doxxed. What I use now.

**Body:** Yeah, the title says it all. Happened last month. We were in a heated competitive match, trash talk was flying. Next thing I know, some salty opponent from the other team somehow got our IPs. Started sending weird threats, found our socials, it was a nightmare. We all thought we were safe because "we're just gamers."

Turns out, your IP is a direct link to your city, your ISP, and with a little effort, a lot more. I went into a deep dive researching VPNs afterwards. Needed something that wouldn't kill my ping for gaming (obviously), could handle streaming for the boys' movie nights, and was a true no-logs provider.

I landed on Surfshark after testing a few. The speed is insane—I actually get better ping to some servers because my ISP isn't throttling my "gaming" traffic anymore. The real kicker? I tested it on Netflix last night. Switched through like 5 different countries (Japan, UK, Turkey, etc.). The catalog completely changes. It's like having every streaming service for free.

It also has this "Camouflage Mode" so even your ISP can't tell you're using a VPN. After what happened, that's the only peace of mind I'll accept.

Don't be like me. Don't wait for the creep to show up in your Discord DMs. The "us vs. them" isn't just in the game anymore. The "them" is data brokers, ISPs, and salty hackers. Get a shield.
